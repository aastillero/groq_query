# AI Task Creation Process

**Instructions:** To document a new task, follow this process. This ensures that all work is tracked in a consistent and organized manner.

1.  **Create the `ai_docs` Directory:** If it doesn't already exist, create a directory named `ai_docs` in the project root. This folder will store all task-related markdown files.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ai_docs
    ```

2.  **Determine the Next Task Number:** Check the existing files in the `ai_docs` directory to find the highest current number (e.g., if `003-some-feature.md` is the last one, the next number is `004`).

3.  **Create the New Task File:**
    *   Copy the entire content of this template (`task_template.md`).
    *   Create a new file in the `ai_docs` directory with the name `NNN-brief-task-name.md`, where `NNN` is the next number (e.g., `004`) and `brief-task-name` is a short, descriptive name for the task (e.g., `add-user-profile-page`).
    *   Paste the copied template content into the new file.

4.  **Fill Out the Template:** Complete all the sections in the new task file to provide a comprehensive overview of the task for the AI agent.

5.  **Confirm with the User:** Present the completed task document to the user and ask for explicit approval before beginning the implementation.

# AI Task Template

**Instructions:** This template helps you create comprehensive task documents for AI-driven development. Fill out each section thoroughly to ensure the AI agent has all necessary context and can execute the task systematically.

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
<!-- Provide a clear, specific title for this task -->
**Title:** Implement Real-time Audio Streaming for Voice Chat

### Goal Statement
<!-- One paragraph describing the high-level objective  -->
**Goal:** Add real-time audio streaming capability to the Flutter AI assistant app, enabling users to have natural voice conversations with Groq AI. This will enhance user experience by eliminating the need for manual text input and creating a more human-like interaction.

## 2. Project analysis and Current State

### Technology and Architecture
<!-- 
AI Agent: Analyze the project to fill this out.
- Check `pubspec.yaml` for Flutter/Dart dependencies and versions.
- Check `/lib/main.dart` for app structure and routing.
- Check `/lib/services/` for service layer pattern implementation.
- Check `/lib/widgets/` and `/lib/screens/` for UI patterns.
- Check platform-specific directories: `ios/`, `android/`, `macos/`, `web/` for native configurations.
-->
- **Framework & Versions:** [Flutter 3.16.0, Dart 3.2.0]
- **Language:** [Dart 3.2.0 with null safety]
- **State Management:** [Provider pattern]
- **UI Framework:** [Material Design 3]
- **API Communication:** [HTTP package]
- **Native Integrations:** [SharedPreferences, Path Provider, Provider]
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** [Provider state management, Repository pattern]
- **Relevant Existing Components:** [Check `lib/main.dart:35`, `lib/services/chat_service.dart`, `lib/services/audio_service.dart`, `lib/widget/home_page.dart`]

### Current State
<!-- Describe what exists today based on acutual analysis -->
Current app has basic voice recording and audio playback functionality in `lib/services/audio_service.dart` with startRecording() and stopRecording() methods. Users must manually trigger recording, wait for completion, then playback responses. There's no streaming capability - entire audio must finish recording/loading before playback begins, creating latency issues.

---

## 3. Context and Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
<!-- A detailed description of the problem. What is the user/business need? What is the pain point being solved? -->
**Problem:** The current audio feature has high latency due to waiting for full recordings/transcriptions before processing. There's no real-time audio streaming, making voice interactions feel slow and unnatural. Users must wait 5-10 seconds between speaking and hearing AI responses.

### Success Criteria
<!-- What are the specific, measurable outcomes that will indicate the task is complete and successful? -->
**Success looks like:** 
- Real-time audio streaming with <2 second latency
- Users hear AI responses as they're being generated
- Smooth bidirectional voice conversation flow
- Handle both streaming transcription and streaming audio playback
- Support for audio interruption (user can speak while AI is responding)

---

## 4. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
<!-- List the specific user-facing features or capabilities that must be implemented. -->
**Must-haves:**
- Real-time audio recording with streaming
- Streaming audio playback as AI generates responses
- Seamless bidirectional voice conversation
- Audio interruption handling
- Visual indicators for streaming states (recording, processing, speaking)

### Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- List technical constraints or quality attributes (e.g., performance, security, accessibility, logging). -->
**Quality attributes:**
- Latency <2 seconds end-to-end
- Robust error handling for network issues
- Background audio support on mobile
- Memory efficient streaming with proper cleanup
- Cross-platform iOS/Android compatibility

---

## 5. State Management and Data Handling

### Local Storage
<!-- Describe any SharedPreferences or local data storage needs. -->
**Data storage:** Use SharedPreferences for audio settings (sensitivity, playback speed), manage streaming context state with Provider for real-time audio state synchronization

### API Integration
<!-- Detail any new API endpoints or service methods in service classes. -->
**Service endpoints:**
- `POST /groq-ai/chat/stream`: [Real-time streaming chat endpoint with audio conversion]
- `AudioStreamService.startRealTimeTranscription()`: [Real-time audio transcription from microphone stream using Whisper streaming]
- `StreamingChatService.startRealTimeChat()`: [Bidirectional streaming combining real-time transcription + LLM using Groq's streaming completions]
- `playAudioStream()`: [Streaming audio playback implementation for LLM response chunks]

**Real-time Flow Implementation:**
```dart
// Technical implementation details
AudioStream -> Real-time Whisper -> Streaming LLM -> Audio Response Chunks
```

**Key Classes:**
- `AudioStreamService`: Handles real-time audio input streaming
- `StreamingChatService`: Manages bidirectional transcription + LLM pipeline
- `RealtimeGroqService`: Uses Groq's streaming completions endpoint (`stream: true`)

## 6. Flutter UI Implementation

### New Widgets
<!-- List any new Flutter widgets to be created. Describe their properties and state. -->
**New UI components:**
- `AudioRecorderStream`: [State-ful widget for real-time audio recording with streaming indicators]
- `AudioPlayerStream`: [State-ful widget for streaming audio playback with visualizers]
- `ConversationControls`: [State-less widget for audio streaming controls (record/stop/interrupt)]

### Screen Updates
<!-- Describe changes to existing screens or navigation. -->
**Screen modifications:**
- `HomePage`: [Update to support real-time voice mode toggle from text/voice modes]
- `ChatScreen`: [Add streaming audio visualizers and real-time status indicators]
